# Terms of Use (EULA)

Service Agreement for `Imagine Diffusion` users and customers.

## Description

By using our products you agree to follow and be bound by this Terms and all revisions of it, including those set forth in our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.MD), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the Terms at any time here.

## App Store

If you purchase our products from the App Store, [Apple’s EULA](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) applies, apart from the points listed on this page where they are described more precise or more specific.


## License

Our apps are sold in units of “simultaneous users”, meaning that if you purchase a copy of one of our apps, you can install it on all of your compatible devices – as long as only one person is using it at any particular moment.

## Refunds

You may be entitled to request a refund of your purchase on `reportaproblem.apple.com` (see also Apple’s EULA). We kindly ask you to contact us before considering a refund — We constantly want to improve our apps and services, and your feedback is crucial to that.

## Bugs

Even though we strive for perfection it’s nearly impossible to build great software that is bug-free. We know that’s difficult to accept in some circumstances as an end user since it is bugging us ourselves. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee malfunction-free operation, including the possibility of data loss or critical failure. We encourage you to back up your data regularly.

## Applicable Laws & Legal

You should not reverse-engineer, disassemble, “crack”, or otherwise modify and redistribute our software. You should not rent or lease your purchase or subscription to others.


## Support

We try to answer all of our tech support and other emails within 7 business days. Sometimes we may get behind, and we appreciate your patience.

## Intellectual Proprietary Rights

Brands, program source code and artwork, including interface design, icons are the copyrighted property of Nikita Rossik.
